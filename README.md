# UdpNtpClient_ESP8266WiFi
UDP NTP Client for ESP8266WiFi Dev Board

This is an Arduino Sketch for the keyestudio ESP8266 WI-FI development board and is intended to demonstrate how to (1) connect to Wifi (2) query a network time protocol server and display the current time in the serial monitor.

This work was inspired and adapted from previous work in the public domain by Michael Margolis 2010, Tom Igoe 2012, and Arturo Guadalupi 2015. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/UdpNtpClient
